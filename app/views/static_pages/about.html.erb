<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>
	I am Kalash Tuladhar, learning Ruby on Rails to finish a project that has been in my head following an incident that has angered me to no bounds. With the completion of this project, I hope to have helped humanity in my own way. <p>

  <p>
  	The <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a>
  is a project to make a book and screencasts to teach web development
  with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. This
  is the sample application for the tutorial.
